<h2>What is UX design</h2>
<strong>User experience (UX)</strong> design is the process design teams use to create products that <u>provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users.
</u> <br>This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design, usability and function.

<p style="margin-top:20px;">“User Experience Design” is often used interchangeably with terms such as “User Interface Design” and “Usability”.
    However, while usability and user interface (UI) design are important aspects of UX design, they are subsets of it –
    UX design covers a vast array of other areas, too. A UX designer is concerned with the entire process of acquiring and integrating a product,
    including aspects of branding, design, usability and function. It is a story that begins before the device is even in the user’s hands.</p>
