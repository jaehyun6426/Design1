<h2>What is UI design</h2>
<strong>The “UI” in UI design stands for “user interface.”</strong> The user interface is the graphical layout of an application.
<br>It consists of the buttons users click on, the text they read, the images, sliders, text entry fields, and all
<br>the rest of the items the user interacts with. This includes screen layout, transitions, interface animations
<br>and every single micro-interaction. Any sort of visual element, interaction, or animation must all be designed.

<p style="margin-top:40px;">This job falls to UI designers. They decide what the application is going to look like. They have to choose color
   schemes and button shapes — the width of lines and the fonts used for text. UI designers create the look and feel
   of an application’s user interface.
